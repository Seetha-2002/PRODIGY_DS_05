Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

## Introduction
Traffic accidents are a major concern globally, causing significant loss of life, injury, and property damage. Understanding the factors contributing to these accidents can help in developing preventive measures and enhancing road safety. In this project, we analyze the US_Accidents_March23 dataset to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. By leveraging data visualization and analysis techniques, we aim to uncover insights into accident hotspots and the contributing factors that can inform policy-making and public awareness campaigns.

## About the Dataset
The US_Accidents_March23 dataset is a comprehensive collection of traffic accident records across the United States. The dataset contains detailed information on each accident, including:

-**Start_Time**: The timestamp of when the accident occurred.
-**End_Time**: The timestamp of when the accident was cleared.
-**Start_Lat**: The latitude of the accident's starting location.
-**Start_Lng**: The longitude of the accident's starting location.
-**Severity**: The severity of the accident on a scale from 1 to 4.
-**Weather_Condition**: The weather conditions at the time of the accident.
-**Road_Condition**: The condition of the road when the accident occurred (if available).

## Conclusion
Through our analysis of the US_Accidents_March23 dataset, we identified several key patterns and insights. Weather conditions, time of day, and specific days of the week significantly impact the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. For instance, adverse weather conditions such as rain or snow tend to increase accident rates, while accidents are more frequent during peak traffic hours. Additionally, we identified geographical hotspots with higher accident occurrences, providing a clear focus for targeted safety measures.
By visualizing these patterns, we can better understand the dynamics of traffic accidents and work towards mitigating them. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to improve road infrastructure, implement better traffic management systems, and create public awareness campaigns to promote safer driving practices. Our ultimate goal is to reduce the number and severity of traffic accidents, making roads safer for everyone.
